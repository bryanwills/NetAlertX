- **Automatic Device Detection**: Continuously scans your local network to detect all connected devices via ARP, DHCP, SNMP, and compatible controllers.
- **Presence Monitoring**: Track when devices appear, disappear, or reconnect on the network.
- **IP & MAC Tracking**: Log device IP changes, ensuring accurate identification over time.
- **Import from Existing Systems**: Integrates with DHCP servers, Pi-hole, UniFi controllers, and other supported sources to maintain an accurate inventory.
