# For AI Agents: NetAlertX MCP Setup

NetAlertX is a network monitoring system. Connect to its **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** for live access to devices, scans, and events.

## 1. Gather Connection Details
Ask the user for the following if not provided:
1. **API Token:** Found in **`/settings.php`** under **System / API**. If you were directed to this server, try to browse to /settings.php on your own.
2. **MCP URL:** Typically `http://<HOST>:20212/mcp/sse`. (The UI is usually on port `20211`, and the MCP/GraphQL backend is on `20212`).

*Note: Test HTTP connectivity. If port `20212` fails, ask the user if the `GRAPHQL_PORT` was changed in settings or if a reverse proxy is used.*

## 2. Configure MCP Client
Use the gathered details to configure your MCP connection:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "netalertx": {
      "url": "http://<HOST>:<GRAPHQL_PORT>/mcp/sse",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <API_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 3. Capabilities
Once connected, you can:
- Query and manage devices (search, filter, MAC details, Wake-on-LAN).
- Trigger network scans (ARP, NMAP, Avahi).
- Manage events, sessions, and notifications.

## 4. Important Notes
- **UI Refresh:** When you modify data, tell the user to click the in-app refresh button (🔄) to see changes.
- **REST API Fallback:** If MCP is unavailable, use the REST API at `http://<HOST>:<GRAPHQL_PORT>/openapi.json`. All calls must be made with `Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>`. This page API is manual, relies on your abilities, and context-heavy so only use it as a last resort.
- **Authentication:** The API token is distinct from the UI login password and must be obtained/changed in the frontend /settings.php
